This is our project for Nasa Space Apps Challenge 2016 for the Don't Crash My Drone challenge.

@master branch
This is the android app that simulates a drone, mainly used as a replacement for the sensors that come inside the drone (GPS, accelerometer and gyroscope).

@simulator branch
This is the drone simulator based on Unity(game engine), which responds to movements from the above android app and receives weather updates from the java server (uploaded "ServerModule.rar" file in this repository).
