This is our project for Nasa Space Apps Challenge 2016 for the Don't Crash My Drone challenge.

@master branch This is the android app that simulates a drone, mainly used as a replacement for the sensors that come inside the drone (GPS, accelerometer and gyroscope).

@simulator branch This is the drone simulator based on Unity(game engine), which responds to movements from the above android app and receives weather updates from the java server (uploaded "ServerModule.rar" file in this repository).

@ServerModule branch This branch contains the ServerModule.rar file which is the Java server that gathers all the required info to keep the drone safe using different APIs.
